# MEILI Android Mobility Collector 

Ongoing port of the existing Android Mobility Collector to ensure compatibility with the MEILI API (v2api and master)

The code can compile, but the following will be needed to extend it:

  - Document
  - Get rid of lots of legacy code
  - Investigate the possibility of integrating Google Fused Location Listener API
